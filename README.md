# Disconnect 24 Installer

The DC24 Installer app will patch nwc24msg.cfg and the necessary IOSes on the Wii itself to make Disconnect24 install smoothly and easily.

In the past, you had to do a lot of the work yourself on a computer when installing a WC24 revival service. This Lua-based app is designed to do all of the work for you on your Wii, and in future to hopefully act as a hub for everything DC24.
