# Source code

This is the source code for the DC24 channel that can be compiled in DevkitPPC at your leisure - the source code is also open to editing and improvements, if you see any improvements please submit them via pull request!

(I have uploaded this as I have indefinitely stopped development. This is a simple but working libwiigui template that can be modified for this channel.)

Note: libwiigui was designed for devkitppc r24 and before. You must fix MAXPATHLEN to compile on the latest devkitppc.
