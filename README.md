# Disconnect 24 Channel

### By TheMrIron2 and KuraiKokoro


The DC24 Channel will patch nwc24msg.cfg and the necessary IOSes on the Wii itself to make Disconnect24 install smoothly and easily, along with installing updates and checking the latest DC24 announcements.

In the past, you had to do a lot of the work yourself on a computer when installing a WC24 revival service. This Lua-based app is designed to do all of the work for you on your Wii, and to hopefully act as a hub for everything DC24.

(Thanks to Tantric for his work on libwiigui, the project would have taken a lot longer without it https://github.com/dborth/libwiigui)
